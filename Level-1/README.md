# Level 1 – Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis

## Objective
To work with a raw housing dataset and prepare it for analysis by performing data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

---

## Dataset
House Prediction Dataset  
The dataset contains multiple numerical features related to housing characteristics and a target variable representing house prices.

---

## Tasks Performed

### Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Loaded the raw dataset using pandas
- Fixed data formatting issues and assigned appropriate column names
- Verified data types and ensured consistency
- Removed duplicate records
- Saved the cleaned dataset for further analysis

### Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed summary statistics to understand data distribution
- Visualized feature distributions using histograms and boxplots
- Examined relationships between variables using scatter plots
- Identified correlations between features using a correlation heatmap

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

---

## Outcome
The dataset was successfully cleaned and explored, key patterns and relationships were identified, and the data was prepared for machine learning tasks in subsequent levels.
